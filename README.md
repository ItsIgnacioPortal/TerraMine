[![Check Build](https://github.com/jakeb072001/TerraCraft/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jakeb072001/TerraCraft/actions)

TerraCraft is a WIP mod that adds everything (or at least close to) from Terraria into Minecraft.  
Not really ready for release yet, but you can still try it if you want.
